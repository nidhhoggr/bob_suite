Follow the steps below to properly configure the Comment alter taxonomy module.

1.  Enable the module from the admin/build/modules page.
2.  If you have not already done so, create one or more vocabularies from the
    admin/content/taxonomy page.  Comment alter taxonomy supports all types
    of vocabularies, including free tagging and multiple select vocabularies.
    Make sure that you specify the content types to which each vocabulary
    applies when editing the vocabulary.
3.  Go to the Comment alter taxonomy admin settings page at
    admin/settings/comment_alter_taxonomy and check each vocabulary
    that you want to be alterable from comments.  You will need to have the
    "administer site configuration" permission to access this page.
4.  Go to the Access control administration page at admin/user/access and
    specify which user roles have the permission to alter terms from comments
    for each vocabulary.

NOTE:  For a user to be able to change the terms on a node from a comment,
*both* of the following conditions must be true:
  a) The vocabulary must be set to be alterable from comments (step 3 above).
  b) The user must have the permission to alter terms from comments for the
     given node type (step 4 above).
